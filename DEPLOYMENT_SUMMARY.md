## Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment - clean code and add deployment docs"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
- Copy `server/env.example` to `server/.env` and configure
- Copy `client/env.example` to `client/.env` and configure
- Set up environment variables in your hosting platform

### 3. Deploy Backend
Choose your preferred platform:
- **Render.com**: Connect repo, set root to `server`
- **Railway**: Connect repo, set root to `server`
- **Heroku**: Connect repo, set buildpack to `heroku/nodejs`

### 4. Deploy Frontend
Choose your preferred platform:
- **Netlify**: Connect repo, build command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- **Vercel**: Connect repo, set root to `client`
- **GitHub Pages**: Use the provided GitHub Actions workflow

### 5. Update Frontend API URL
Once backend is deployed, update the `VITE_API_URL` in your frontend environment variables.

## Hosting Platform Recommendations

### Backend (Node.js)
- **Render.com** - Free tier available, easy setup
- **Railway** - Good free tier, simple deployment
- **Heroku** - Reliable, but requires credit card for free tier

### Frontend (React)
- **Netlify** - Excellent for React apps, great free tier
- **Vercel** - Optimized for React, fast deployments
- **GitHub Pages** - Free, integrated with GitHub

## Security Checklist
- [ ] All API keys moved to environment variables
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] CORS configured for production domains
- [ ] No sensitive data in code
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on hosting platforms
